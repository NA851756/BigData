echo "I am working on a Linux Server." >> /home/hduser/userdata.txt
echo "I am learning to work on Hadoop ecosystem." >> /home/hduser/userdata.txt


b. Create a folder called training under your home directory in HDFS
Write the command used here:

hadoop fs -mkdir /user/hduser/training


c. Create a folder called SampleData under training
Write the command used here:

hadoop fs -mkdir -p /user/hduser/training/SampleData

d. Copy file userdata.txt to SampleData folder in HDFS
Write the command used here:

hadoop fs -put /home/hduser/userdata.txt /user/hduser/training/SampleData/

e. Display the content of userdata.txt in hdfs using cat command
Write the command used here:

hadoop fs -cat /user/hduser/training/SampleData/userdata.txt

f. Create another directory called SampleDataBak under training directory in HDFS
Write the command used here:

hadoop fs -mkdir -p /user/hduser/training/SampleDataBak

g. Copy the file userdata.txt from SampleData folder to SampleDataBak:
Write the command used here:

hadoop fs -cp /user/hduser/training/SampleData/userdata.txt /user/hduser/training/SampleDataBak

h. List all sub-folders and files under training folder in HDFS:
Write the command used here:

hadoop fs -ls -R /user/hduser/training

i. Display the total disk space used by training directory
Write the command used here:

hadoop fs -du /user/hduser/training

j. Display the disk space used by each folder under training directory
Write the command used here:

hadoop fs -df /user/hduser/training

k. Change the Replication factor of training/SampleData/userdata.txt to 2
Write the command used here:

hadoop fs -setrep -w 2 /user/hduser/training/SampleData/userdata.txt

l. Browse the training folder in HDFS using Web UI (localhost:50070) and note down the following:
File / Folder Name Size Replication Block Size
training
userdata.txt (under SampleData)
userdata.txt (under SampleDataBak)
Sensitivity: Internal & Restricted

m. Delete training folder along with all sub folders and files:
Write the command used here:

hadoop fs -rm -r 2 /user/hduser/training
